## GrayCraft

I am a TypeScript and JavaScript Developer with extensive work experience in organizations worldwide, including lead positions.

Impressive experience in WebDev (raised several startups), competence in versatile aspects of a modern web development.

In the early 2010s, I completed many [Freelance](https://freelance.ru/graycraft) projects like product calculators, widgets, paint apps, simple games, etc.

Having gained full experience with libraries and APIs prevalent at that time, I switched to serious enterprise projects.

In September 2015, I got a remote position for one of the [REG.RU](https://reg.ru) projects as a Middle Web Frontend Developer.

The graycraft.io website (based on own UI components library Shell) was initially released in Feb 2017.

From 2017 to 2018 I was engaged in development and support of enterprise management system for a [local ISP](https://insisnet.ru).

October 2019 to 2022 I had a pleasant experience working on the [PIK LLC subprojects](https://www.pik.ru).

Long term participation in a well known cryptocurrency project till these days.

Worked directly with many public and private APIs (REST, WebSocket).

Today I work with Next.js/React and NestJS/Fastify primarily, familiar with Angular, Vue and Express as well.

Experience in a commercial development on the TypeScript/Next.js stack for more than 5 years in a row.

Prefer to deal with various Linux based distributions in development and production environments.

Have been engaged in administrative tasks on Debian/Ubuntu, Gentoo and Tails since 2011.
